# Secret Friend App 

The **Secret Friend App** is a simple practice alura project that lets users randomly select a "secret friend" from a list of names. It was created as a challenge to practice JavaScript and DOM manipulation.

## Features

1. **Add Names**: Users can enter a friend's name in a text field and add it to a visible list by clicking the "Add" button.
2. **Input Validation**: If the text field is empty, the app will alert the user to enter a valid name.
3. **View List**: All entered names will appear in a list below the input field.
4. **Random Draw**: Clicking the "Draw Friend" button will randomly select a name from the list and display it on the screen.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: For basic styling.
- **JavaScript**: For app logic and DOM manipulation.

## How to Use the App

1. Open the application in your browser.
2. Enter names in the text field and click "Add" for each friend.
3. Once you've added all the names, click "Draw Friend" to reveal the secret friend.
